## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Sergei Ivlev, the head of the X-ray service facility at the Chemistry Department of Philipps University of Marburg. ðŸ”¬

This is my private GitHub account where I experiment with programming and possibly run a few hobby projects in my free time. The code related to crystallography and applied fields can be found in (or will be soon moved to) [@umrxray](https://github.com/umrxray). ðŸ’»
