### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Sergei Ivlev, the head of the X-ray service facility at the Chemistry Department of Philipps University of Marburg.

This GitHub account is where I experiment with programming and share projects related to education and research in crystallography, math and related fields. You will also find some of my purely hobby projects that are not related to work.
